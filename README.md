# codingground

Here I will be putting my code/programs which I practice usually in C/C++, python, C#, JavaScript/Jquery. I can also write code in other languages as per the requirement. Aim is to help out with basic programs and logics

- you can find codes for different programs here.
- you can also raise your doubts and questions regarding any program
- you can ask any program to write from scratch here

- please do not commit your code without testing it.

update as on 08/05/18 :  Now programs are also available in unix/shell scripting.
